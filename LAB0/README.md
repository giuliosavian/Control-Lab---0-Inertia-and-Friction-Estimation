<!-- INTRO OF THE PROJECT -->
## Activity goal

The goal of this laboratory activity is to design a position PID controller for the DC servomotor available in laboratory. The design is carried out in frequency domain (i.e Bode’s method) with the adoption of a nominal model of the motor, whose parameters are deduced from data–sheets. In the second part of the activity, the values of the motor parameters, including the static and viscous friction, are estimated with simple experimental tests. The parameters will be used in the next laboratory activity to improve the control performances,in particular by implementing a feedforward inertia plus friction compensation scheme.

The project will touch:
1. Simulink model of the DC servomotor with inertial load
2. Design and numerical validation of the position PID controller
3. Validation of the position PID controller with the motor black-box model
4. Estimation of the friction parameters
5. Estimation of the inertia parameters
